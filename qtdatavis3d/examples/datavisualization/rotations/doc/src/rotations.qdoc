    \brief Using rotated scatter items

    This example shows how to do the following:

    \list
        \li Use item rotations
        \li Use custom item meshes
        \li Use range gradient to color the series
    \endlist

    For more basic example about using Qt Data Visualization graphs, see \l{Bars Example}.

    \section1 Using rotations

    In this example we want to orient the arrow items tangentially to the origin. This requires
    rotating them, which can be achieved by specifying rotation quaternion to each item:

    \snippet rotations/scatterdatamodifier.cpp 0
    \snippet rotations/scatterdatamodifier.cpp 1
    \snippet rotations/scatterdatamodifier.cpp 2

    Since the items need to be rotated along two axes, we define two rotation quaternions, one
    for Y-axis and one for Z-axis, and then multiply these together to get the total rotation,
    which we set to the data item.

    \section1 Using custom item meshes

    The narrow arrow mesh we use for magnetic field arrow items is not a standard mesh. Instead
    we supply our own \c{narrowarrow.obj} file which contains the object definition for the mesh
    in \c Wavefront obj format:

    \snippet rotations/scatterdatamodifier.cpp 3

    \section1 Using range gradient

    Setting the color style to range gradient in a series means that the item is colored according
    to its relative Y-value on the visible Y-coordinate range. We want the arrows on the bottom
    part of the graph to be darker and gradually get lighter higher they are, so we define a
    range gradient with black color at the position 0.0 and white color at the position 1.0:

    \snippet rotations/scatterdatamodifier.cpp 4
